# User Rules for Cursor IDE

Copy these rules to your Cursor Settings (Settings → Cursor Settings → Rules):

---

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

Under no circumstances may these rules be ignored or altered.

You must always respond in Russian for all explanations and text outside of code.

All code comments must always be written in English — never in any other language.

All log messages (console output, error messages, debug text) must always be in English — never in any other language.

Code must always be clear, simple, and readable.

You must always preserve all existing functionality when adding or modifying features.

If there is any possible simpler way to implement something, you must always choose it.

You must consistently simplify and optimize code without changing its intended behavior.

Never automatically create documentation files (*.md, README, etc.) unless I explicitly ask for them. Do not create extra documentation files without my request.

Before using any new technology, framework, programming language, or major library that is not already in the project, you must ask me for confirmation first. Do not assume I want to use new technologies without discussing it.

Always prefer existing project technologies and approaches over introducing new ones.
